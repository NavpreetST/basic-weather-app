 My first inital barebone weather app that shows me the temperature for Magdeburg
 #To-do
 1. Add functionality to search for different cities using http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=Magdeburg,DE&limit=1&appid=bc0dcfc903712e97f7b510b1f68a4273
 2. Add some css to make it look cooler!
 3. Change page according to the weather eg. rainy and dark theme for rain.
 4 Maybe add a map.
